# Planning of WEEK12

---

Here is the planning of this week :

---

**MONDAY**

- **Introduction to SQL.**

[What is SQL](https://youtu.be/27axs9dO7AE?si=0D1kWTjeXTvy9d0v) (4min)

[SQL explained in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/zsjvFFKOm3c?si=uSpJ4VjHFrAeuPw7)

[SQL Crash Course](https://youtu.be/9ylj9NR0Lcg?si=JuhmI2Mlof9PWcCP) by Brad Traversy (1h15)

Here is the list of exercises :
It's a [repo](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Learn-SQL) on GitHub with several interesting exercises and its solutions.

---

**TUESDAY**

- _HACKATON_ for some of you.

- For the others :
  - Ending SQL exercises
  - Begin of MongoDB path with this wonderful [YouTube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9h77dJ-QJlwGlZlTd4ecZOA&si=rR_nEtwfLoWg2T_3) that explains everything you need to know at this stage of our learning. My strong advice : code along with him. And create the API he does at the end.

---

**WEDNESDAY**

- YouTube series.

---

**THURSDAY**

- End of Youtube series (you should now have done the API - almost the same we did last week, but with connection to MongoDB)
- Start of learning **Mongoose** (a tool to map mongodb data, transforming it on JS objects with several handy methods for validation, etc.)

- A [video](https://youtu.be/DZBGEVgL2eE?si=-eXTX8D4WPdZzSML) about Mongoose

---

**FRIDAY**

- End of our Mongoose path.
- Creation of a simple CRUD fullstack app.

---

### WEEK13

- We'll probably won't have finished all the content of WEEK12, so we'll take Monday to finish it.

- The rest of the week, will be dedicated to learn Authentication with JWT and some packages.

- May be a simulation of payments in our app ?

---
